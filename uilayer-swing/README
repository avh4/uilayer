IF YOU ARE GETTING TEST FAILURES:  Many of the uilayer-swing tests are testing
pixel-perfect rendering of visual components.  Some versions of the JDK differ
in how aliasing is performed when doing text rendering.  If you are seeing
tests fail, make sure you are using OpenJDK-1.7u, available from
http://code.google.com/p/openjdk-osx-build/  (version
OpenJDK-OSX-1.7-universal-u-jdk-u8-b04-20120823.dmg is known to work).  This is
known to work on OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard), 10.7 (Lion), and 10.8 (Mountain
Lion).  This is also compatible with the OpenJDK-1.7 version used on Travis-CI
build machines as of 2012.
