IF YOU ARE GETTING TEST FAILURES:  Many of the uilayer-swing tests are testing
pixel-perfect rendering of visual components.  Some versions of the JDK differ
in how aliasing is performed when doing text rendering.  If you are seeing
tests fail, make sure you are using OpenJDK-1.7u, available from
http://code.google.com/p/openjdk-osx-build/  (version
OpenJDK-OSX-1.7-universal-u-jdk-u8-b04-20120823.dmg is known to work).  This is
known to work on OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard), 10.7 (Lion), and 10.8 (Mountain
Lion).

If you get such failures, you should also see a report of the JVM version.  Use
the java.version value in the report to add the incompatibility to the list in
RequiresPreciseFontRendering.Rule.  This will cause the font rendering tests to
be skipped on that JVM version.

## Disabling antialiasing

Set the Java system property uilayer.swing.antialiasing=false to disable
antialiasing.  This is useful when tests are run on multiple machines, since
Java implementations across different platforms are likely to antialias
slightly differently.

When running tests, pass this as a JVM argument:

    -Duilayer.swing.antialiasing=false

When using maven, add this to your pom.xml:

    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>2.12.3</version>
                <configuration>
                    <systemPropertyVariables>
                        <uilayer.swing.antialiasing>false</uilayer.swing.antialiasing>
                    </systemPropertyVariables>
                </configuration>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
